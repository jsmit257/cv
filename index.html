            After Twilio's acquisition of Sendgrid, continued development and maintenance for Account
            Management and Revenue Assurance projects described in the next section on contract work
            at Sendgrid.
          </dd>
          <dt>Twilio Integration</dt>
          <dd>
            Supported efforts to bridge the gap between Sendgrid's and Twilio's unrelated AuthN/AuthZ
            models. Worked with the first stage to use Sendgrid authentication to generate Twilio tokens
            that were trusted by the existing framework.
          </dd>
          <dt>Login Enhancements</dt>
          <dd>
            Worked through multiple iterations of incorporating MFA into Sendgrid's existing login logic.
            UX proved challenging and A|B testing discovered many opinions from users about their expectations
            regarding simplicity vs. security. Worked closely with business teams to explain technical
            challenges and to develop workflows that could be embraced by users and engineers.
          </dd>
          <dt>AWS Migrations</dt>
          <dd>
            Helped develop a solution for transitioning legacy system's data to the next-gen platform
            for combined AM and RA services. Included an event driven system to signal changes to the
            legacy data model (via Debezium) to a monitor that would aggregate the current state of an
            account from multiple databases/services and patch the new system of record with the complete
            account. Included a debouncer to avoid redundant requests generated by asynchronous updates
            for single transactions.
          </dd>
          <dt>K8S Migrations</dt>
          <dd>
            When it was impractical to fully migrate systems from on-prem VMs to less costly solutions
            in the cloud, an interim solution was adopted to migrate CentOS servers to Docker containers
            run in local K8S clusters, saving vast amounts of resources and reducing time to deploy from
            hours of chef-ing to a few minutes. Included re-routing public requests, repointing local
            endpoints and finally decommissioning unused servers.
          </dd>
          <dt>SSM</dt>
          <dd>
            Worked closely with DevOps and Security teams to remove sensitive artifacts from code repos nd replace them
            with secure access from AWS secure secrets manager. Supported versions for both Chef and K8S. Rotated the
            key-store as recommended by security best-practices.

          <dt>Auditing</dt>
          <dd>
            A follow-on to AWS migrations involved snapshotting the current account state from multiple
            legacy and new services for the purpose of identifying disparities between data sets. Because
            of the large amount data that appears to be suspect, developed targetted jq scripts to extract
            only portions of the bulk audit and transform them to various views addressing various concerns.
          </dd>
          <dt>Automation for Account Integrity</dt>
          <dd>
            Comprehensive system for merging and transforming data from audits created by multiple teams/systems
            to provide a broader perspective of integrity across systems, including ones not owned by our teams.
            Configured with a single YAML, pulled from multiple data sources (S3, RDBMS, static data, etc),
            included multiple outputs to persist results. Triggers could be database writes, queue publications,
            inbound requests, etc. Completed jobs can be configured to notify based on results.

            Took ownership of a SQS->Kafka/Kafka->SQS forwarder to facilitate a larger initiative
            for migrating on-prem VMs to AWS solutions. This allowed moving single services at a time
            without interrupting existing subscriptions. Included checks for cycles in the forwarding
            graph that would result in infinite message loops.
          </dd>
          <dt>Revenue Assurance (Billing)</dt>
          <dd>
            Worked with the team creating a new account model to replace existing MySQL databases. The
            persistence layer also mapped legacy auto-generated primary keys to the newer, UUID-based
            scheme to bridge the gap between legacy and newer systems, and gradually mapped existing
            attributes from on-prem servers to DynamoDB.
